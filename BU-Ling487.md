## *NEW COURSE PROPOSAL (Boğaziçi Linguistics)*

1.  COURSE CODE, TITLE AND CREDIT:

    Ling487: Mathematics and Philosophy in Linguistics

2.  CATALOG DESCRIPTION: Mathematics of linguistic description and
    grammar. Computational infrastructure of linguistic description.
    Formal grammars in relation to natural grammars. Philosophy of
    linguistics and grammar, including nominalism, psychologism,
    realism, mathematicism and computationalism, in the realms of
    extension-intension.

3.  FACULTY MEMBERS WHO CAN TEACH THE COURSE: Prof.dr. Cem Bozşahin

4.  BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT(S): Third-year standing, including first
    courses in general linguistics, phonology, syntax, morphology and
    logic. Knowledge of programming is a plus, but not a requirement.
    There is no programming in the course.

5.  COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAMS: This course is intended as an
    undergraduate level elective in Linguistics. Some material, for
    example 7.II and 7.III below, are covered in computer science
    departments from a different perspective; we will cover them from
    the perspective of linguistics, which is novel to this course. Space
    permitting, the course can also be taken by students of other
    departments who have sufficient interest and background.

6.  COURSE OBJECTIVES: Students are expected to: (a) be able to
    formalize linguistic description, (b) understand its evaluation, (c)
    situate description in the realm of schools of philosophy.

7.  COURSE OUTLINE:

    I. Introduction: A brief history of mathematics and philosophy in
    linguistics (1 week)

    II\. Theory of description: Formal language theory (3 weeks)

    III\. Theory of execution: Automata theory (3 weeks)

IV\. Theory of evaluation: Lambda calculus (3 weeks)

v\. Theory of environment: Basic systems theory (2 weeks)

VI\. Theory of uncertainty: Basic probability theory (2 weeks)

Schools of philosophy covered in the description are discussed
throughout the term.

8.  TEXTBOOK: There is no textbook. The course is supported by lecture
    notes.
